# Contributing to nats-s3

Thanks for your interest in improving nats-s3! This project is in an early stage, so the process is intentionally lightweight.

## Getting Started
- Prerequisites:
  - Go 1.22+
  - Optional: a local NATS server with JetStream enabled for manual testing (`nats-server -js`)
- Build: `go build ./cmd/nats-s3`
- Run: `./nats-s3 --listen 0.0.0.0:5222 --natsServers nats://127.0.0.1:4222`
- Test: `go test ./...`

## How We Work
- Prefer opening an issue or discussion before large changes to align on direction.
- Keep pull requests small, focused, and easy to review.
- Include tests for new behavior or bug fixes when reasonable.
- Update docs when you change user-facing behavior.

## Branching & Commits
- Branch naming suggestions:
  - Features: `feat/<short-description>`
  - Fixes: `fix/<short-description>`
  - Chores/Docs: `chore/<short-description>`, `docs/<short-description>`
- Commit messages: prefer conventional-style prefixes, for example:
  - `feat: add DELETE object route`
  - `fix: correct ETag and Last-Modified headers`
  - `docs: improve README usage examples`
  - `test: add unit tests for object handlers`

## Coding Style
- Run the formatter before committing: `gofmt -s -w .`
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the task at hand.
- Be careful with logging; avoid logging full payloads or sensitive data.
- Favor clear, concise comments and Go-doc comments for exported items.

## Testing
- Run all tests: `go test ./...`
- For NATS-dependent tests, use `github.com/nats-io/nats-server/v2/test` helpers to start an in-process server with JetStream enabled.
- Aim for table-driven tests where practical and prefer deterministic behavior.

## Pull Request Checklist
- [ ] Code is formatted (`gofmt -s`)
- [ ] Unit tests added/updated and passing (`go test ./...`)
- [ ] Behavior and public APIs documented (README or comments)
- [ ] PR description explains the problem and the solution briefly

We appreciate your contributions and feedback! If something is unclear, please open an issue and weâ€™ll help clarify and improve the docs and process.
